# Admission Enquiry Chatbot

The goal of this project is to create an Admission Enquiry Chabot 
that responds to any inquiries posted by students on the college, 
courses, location, cost, and other topics. Machine learning 
techniques are used in the construction of the College Enquiry 
Chatbot project to evaluate user queries and comprehend user 
messages. The web application that answers the question is called 
This System. All one needs to do is submit a question using the bot.

The responses match the questions posed by the user. Through the 
system, the User can inquire about any activity related to college. 

After analyzing the query, the system provides the user with an 
answer. Through the suggestion box, users can also provide 
suggestions. With an efficient Graphical User Interface, the system responds to the user as though a real person were speaking to them. 

This project intends to simplify the admission enquiry 
process by using a user-centric design approach, which will lessen 
the need for manual intervention and the administrative load on 
university staff. An innovative method for improving user 
experience and productivity in higher education admissions 
processes is the Admission Enquiry Chatbot.
